# XPath Extractor & Web Scraping Automation

## Overview
This project is designed to automate web scraping by extracting XPath elements dynamically from a webpage. It utilizes **Flutter** with **flutter_inappwebview** to render web pages and detect user interactions with web elements. The application captures clicked elements' XPath in real-time and displays them in a dedicated section of the interface.

## Features
- **Real-time XPath Recognition:** Detects and records XPath when a user hovers or clicks on an element.
- **Live Display of Extracted XPaths:** Displays the recognized XPaths in a UI panel.
- **Prevents Navigation on Click:** Ensures interactions donâ€™t navigate away from the webpage.
- **Ideal for Web Scraping Automation:** Helps developers and testers gather accurate XPaths for automation.
